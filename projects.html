					Intelligent Positioning System(IPS) for remote acrobatic sports learning - I am developing an intelligent positioning system for helping remote learners of acrobatic activities like Dancing, Yoga, Taekwondo, Karate, etc, where the learner may not be in the same position during the learning session. This system contains a motorized Intelligent Positioning Robot (IPR) to which a smartphone can be attached. An app, Intelligent Positioning App (IPA), on the smartphone provides visual input (image/video stream) to human pose detection algorithms run on the Intelligent Positioning Server (IPS), currently runs on a local server, later on, the cloud. After processing the images, the IPS sends commands to the IPR to adjust the position. This process continues until the image captured on the smartphone is at the optimal position for the activity. As the player moves during the session, the system adjusts the position to provide the best remote learning experience without the playerâ€™s intervention.

							 Used <b>Machine Learning</b> models to determine whether there is an inherent bias based on birth factors and other factors that influences Covid-19 transmission. This machine-learning algorithm is different from others created up till now as it is multi-layered.  The first layer of the model is a KNearestNeighbors algorithm that predicts the education level of an individual based on ethnicity and biological sex. The second layer of the model is a KNearestNeighbors algorithm that predicts the income bracket of an individual based on age, ethnicity, biological sex, education level, and state of residence. The third layer of the model is a Linear Regression function that uses data of covid transmission based on income bracket. Comparing the results of each model, we can predict the chance of an individual to get Covid-19 based on their ethnicity and biological sex.
